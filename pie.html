<center>I got into coding about two years ago when I wanted to make my own Minecraft mod in java (Im still trying to make it because the file was courupt when I transfered it to my new computer ;-( ). Then I joined my school lego robotics team,which the software that I use is alot like Scratch, wherre you drag blocks to link whith each other. I then I learned html adt a coder dojo class (which, by the way, was very easy after learning java). I also use scratch in school and just for fun. So thats how I got into coding.</center>
