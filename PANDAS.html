<center><h1><b><u>Why I Want to Keep on Coding</u></b></h1></center>
<center>I want to keep on coding for many reasons, one of them is it's just so much fun for me.  It is also very useful thing to learn because it helps you later in life if you have to make a website for your job, if you are a game desinger, or if you just want to have fun, coding is great. The world is slowly but surely being taken over by tech! MWAHAHAHA! *ahem* Sorry, I wnt a little overboard there but still coding will be a useful skill when we grow up. so it is alwayss good to start early so that is why I want to keep on coding.</center>
